        let curve = notification.userInfo![UIResponder.keyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey] as! UInt//This sets the type of animation curve(ease in/ ease out or follow keyboard frames etc.) In this case we are making it follow the keyboard notification frames. We HAVE to force cast it as UInt.
        
        let startingFrame = (notification.userInfo![UIResponder.keyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey] as!

We also need to convert it into CGRect to make it a rectangle to put it above the keyboard. Before we can pull CGRect value we have to force cast it as NSValue(Its a container for a single C or obj C data item).

Remember to keep flower brackets for animations.
